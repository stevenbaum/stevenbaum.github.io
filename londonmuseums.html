				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					The London Museum Explorer is a web app designed to help showcase and navigate The Capital's plethora of world-class museums. It's also my small love letter to an incredible city, and a memento of the four months I spent there last fall.

				<h3>Project Context</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					The London Museum Explorer is a personal project resulting from my final semester of college - I spent the end of 2015 studying in central London with a cohort of 100 other students. I took a four-month class on museum studies with a focus on London, and <b><u>I was even able to apply my UX lens to dissect patrons' user journeys as part of an academic paper (see below)</u></b>.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					As both a tourist and student I could experience London's finest, but without the resources of my program and professors I would've had much more difficulty navigating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_London" target="new">over 100 museums</a> populating the city. Thus I decided to see if I could create a platform to direct individuals to museums coinciding with their interests.

				<h3>User Research</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Because I was a one-man team and I had the luxury of being surrounded by my user groups every day, there was less need to create detailed personas than when working with large UX teams and less-accessible user cohorts. I lived next to the British Museum (the museum to end all museums) and during my stay compiled a list of groups who visited <i>of their own accord</i>:
					<ul>
						<li><b>College Students</b> (Excluding school field trips)</li>
						<li><b>Tourists</b> (Excluding guided groups booked via agencies)</li>
						<li><b>Londoners</b> (Professionals on break, seniors, couples, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/britishmuseumsteps.png" />
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					My living situation afforded me constant access to conduct <b><u>interviews</u></b> and <b><u>contextual inquiries</u></b> with these three groups. I could simply walk down the street and find a friend, tourist, or Briton to ask about their reason for visiting the British Museum, and where else they planned to visit.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					<b><u>Online communities</u></b> served as another, more wide-reaching resource. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/london/" target="new">The London subreddit</a> has over 50,000 subscribed members and many more individuals (myself included!) visiting to digest news, events, and dialogues surrounding the city. Visitors often post questions to get advice from locals; such posts were a valuable way to directly access users' motives and goals for experiencing the city.
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/redditpost.png" />
			</div>
			<div class="projectsection">
				<h3>User Research Conclusions</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					I narrowed down a set of key factors determining how individuals or groups approach museum navigation:
				</p>
				<img src="assets/tool_icons/clock.png" />
				<p><b>Time Sensitivity</b></p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Tourists are often limited in the amount of time spent in a foreign city, and can only budget time for so many attractions. Consequently visitors expressed preferences based on seeing the "best" or "top" museums, i.e. <b><u>those with the most valuable or famous contents</u></b>, or simply <b><u>those nearby</u></b>.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<img src="assets/tool_icons/categorypreference.png">
				<p><b>Category Preference</b></p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Some patrons vocalize preferences for particular museum types. Though most museums are implicitly historical, they also fit on a spectrum of categories beyond just 'History' or 'Art'. But as the Reddit post shows, <b><u>patrons can have difficulty finding museums of their interests</u></b>, or <b><u>a museum tailored to someone's interests may be obscured</u></b> by a more prominent museum of a similar category.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<img src="assets/tool_icons/arrows.png">
				<p><b>Spatial Familiarity</b></p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					London is an immense city; it's challenging to navigate and conceptualize. <u><b>Spatial familiarity constrains where in the city a patron will travel</b></u>, with the most universally familiar space radiating out from the very center of the city, around Trafalgar Square.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Consequently I ideated on features that would address these points:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>'Greatest Hits'</b>: Although I aimed to promote exploration, users should easily be able to find the 'top' visited museums.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Categorization</b>: Museums should be arranged in a loose taxonomy based on differences in content.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Spatial Orientation</b>: All museums should include an interactive Google Maps window, and must fall in a reasonable radius from the city center to promote accessibility.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="projectsection">
				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					I considered two alternate platforms for this task: <b><u>travel blogs</u></b> and the <b><u>Google Museum Search</u></b> widget.
				</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					<a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/" target="new">Nomadic Matt</a> was a popular travel blog used by my program peers to plan itineraries:
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/nomadicmatt.png">
				<p class="projectbio">
					<ul>
						<li><span class="green">Advantages</span>: First-hand experience as source, assumes a tourist's knowledge of the city, content is simple & accessible</li>
						<li><span class="red">Disadvantages</span>: Content is static, user has no agency to determine what content appears - blog writer is sole authority</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=museums+in+london&rlz=1C1LENN_enUS438US438&oq=museums+in+london" target="new">Google search</a> also includes a display to navigate between museums:
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/googlemuseums.png">
				<p class="projectbio">
					<ul>
						<li><span class="green">Advantages</span>: Content is dynamic, comprehensive, and the user has agency to explore different locations</li>
						<li><span class="red">Disadvantages</span>: Some content is incorrect or useless (irrelevant URLs, and the "London Museum" doesn't even exist!)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="projectsection">
				<h3>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					After some initial sketching, I translated the designs into Balsamiq wireframes to start iterating on features and information architecture:
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/balsamiq1.png">
				<p>-</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/balsamiq2.png">
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Asking friends to perform a small set of tasks (find The Sherlock Holmes Museum, see what exhibitions are on at Tate Modern) revealed that <b><u>there had to be better navigation means than dropdowns and densely-packed tables</b></u>. Similarly, the same initial 10 museums displayed were always the first ones that users would explore; <b><u>this was creating a visual hierarchy negating the goal of exploration</u></b>.
				</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					While grouping museum subcategories into searchable types, I saw a natural fit for a circular landing page menu:
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/category.gif">
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					The menu accomplished a few important things:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Parity</b>: No category is clearly prioritized over another in a visual context</li>
						<li><b>Onboarding</b>: A simple message - "Explore the Capital's Museums" - provides direction and user agency; the museums they see are direct results of their category selection</li>
						<li><b>Time Buffer</b>: Loading the page triggers API calls to fetch the museum data - taking a moment to select a category ensures all data will be ready when the museums display</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="projectsection">
				<h3>Front-End Development</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					In UX I'm a more skilled developer than graphic designer, so personal projects skip InVision-stage hi-fi protoypes - it's easier for me to dive straight into code once I've established structure and function.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="new">Facebook's React</a> was a perfect fit to help build my site as a dynamic Single-Page Application. Its design pattern of funnel-down UI propagation meant I could run initial API calls, save the results to the top level, and change the museum displays in response to user navigation.
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					<b><u>There was no established way to categorize museums, so I had to devise my own method</u></b>. I found that by cross-referencing 60 Google Maps results for 'museum' around Trafalgar Square with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_London" target="new">an exhaustive Wikipedia chart</a>, I could extract the Wikipedia subcategories into one of five general categories for search: Science & Tech, Art & Design, History, Military, and Media.
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/appcode.png">
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					Many lines of JavaScript and CSS later I had a working live version! I'm partial to a little CSS razzle-dazzle, so I wrote transitions to turn the landing menu into a set of navigable tabs at the bottom - <b><u>this preserves user understanding of site iconography, and switching museum categories remains a simple one-click step.</u></b>
				</p>
				<img class="projectimage" src="assets/museumapp/menutransition.gif">
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					The Google Maps API provides museum metadata, an interactive mini-map display, and photo assets. The Wikipedia API provides a museum's category, as well as informative text pulled from its individual Wikipedia entry.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="projectsection">
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p class="projectbio">
					I'm aiming to iterate on the site and polish it up, but overall I'm quite pleased with the result! It was a great way to develop my UX skills in the context of something I really love, and I enjoyed implementing every step of the design process by myself. I have some great takeaways as well:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Simple design is okay</b>: My original concept was very simple in scope - help showcase and navigate London's museums. At times I felt the need to expand it into something more elaborate, but I was reminded to stick to my guns. Don't add features for features' sake!
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>I need to commit eventually</b>: I can spend hours pointing out things I would change, but the project would never move forward unless I recognized the diminishing returns of constant iteration - at some point I had to say "I need to move forward now and switch gears".
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>-</p>
				<p class="projectbio">
					It's my dream to go back to London and a bigger dream to work there, but for now I'm beyond happy with the opportunity I had to live and breathe the most marvelous place I've ever experienced.
